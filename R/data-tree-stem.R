# I have shared a folder with you via dropbox ***[bcifiles]***. It includes:
#
# -          BCI elevation data
#
# -          BCI 2005 and 2010 stem data
#
# -          BCI 2005 and 2010 tree data
#
# -          BCI species file
#
# -          wood density file, which contains some errors, and will be updated
# soon. However the values for BCI should be fine.
#
# -          a text file with the habitats per 20x20m quadrats, which were
# determined by observation.
#
# However, habitats can also be determined by the slope, convexity, and
# elevation. I am attaching a file I made ***[bci.quad.info.rdata]***, which is
# quite old. You may want to redo this file, or maybe someone else has a better
# one.
#
# The tree and stem data are the most updated ones that we have from Rick.
# Please use a subset of this data only.
#
# Let me know if you have any questions.
#
# Cheers,
# Suzanne
